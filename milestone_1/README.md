Descriptions
-------
We worked on the "Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones" data from Kaggle, and 

We trained and ran a linear classifier on the given training data, and evaluate the model with the given test data.
Then we merged the given train.csv and test.csv to one csv file, and used cross-validation to evaluate the linear classifier.
We did the similar things using decision tree with and without bagging.
